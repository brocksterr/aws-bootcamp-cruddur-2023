#### Homework Stretch Assignments

* ~~Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role~~ - **Done** - Also using temp credentials through MFA with a session token.
* ~~Use EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS and send notification when there is a service health issue~~. - **Done** - Created Evenbridge for all services under aws.health and created an SNS topic to send an email.
* ~~Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool (No specialized lens)~~ - **Done** - Lot of questions for each section. Most seem useful.
* Create an architectural diagram (to the best of your ability) the CI/CD logical pipeline in Lucid Charts
* ~~Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility.~~ - **Done** - I reviewed the list of limits (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) and knew about some of them. Route53, IAM, and WorkSpaces.
* ~~Open a support ticket and request a service limit.~~ - **Done** - I'm considering this done. I didn't open a support ticket, but have opened support tickets in the past for billing and account support. Almost opened a support ticket a while back for Route53 as I'm near the domain limit, but didn't as I'm not there yet.

#### Other Info

Default profile - only used for generating temporary session tokens with MFA.

mfa profile - where session token info is stored, but rotated daily.

aws sts get-session-token --serial-number "arn:aws:iam::*MyAWSAccount#*:mfa/*XXXXXX*" --token-code *XXXXXX*

[mfa]
aws_access_key_id = example-access-key-as-in-returned-output
aws_secret_access_key = example-secret-access-key-as-in-returned-output
aws_session_token = example-session-Token-as-in-returned-output
aws_default_region = us-east-1
